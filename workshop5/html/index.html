                Vegetables are an important part of world cuisine that enabled us 
                to survive trough countless millennia, following us thought the age of early civilizations, 
                rise and fall of many cultures over the last four thousand years, and finally reaching modern popularity 
                that they have today.

No matter where you live, eating vegetables represents important
 part of your daily diet that provides our bodies with important nutrients. Because of their versatility in 
 terms of cooking (we can eat them raw, boiled, cooked, and dried), wide array of cultivation techniques, untold ways 
 they can help us in daily problems that don’t require us eating them, and high nutritional values, vegetables represented 
 extremely important commodity for humankind. During some periods of our growth from early to modern civilization, certain types 
 of vegetables were regarded as extremely important, often being valued more than money, gold or any other commodity that we owned.
